## About the Project


This repository contains the web files for abewheeler.com. I wrote abewheeler.com from scratch in 2018 as a complete rewrite & redesign of my old website, which had been forked from a template.


## Technical Details


I built my static website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and jQuery. I also utilize Font Awesome icons and Formspree HTML forms. The site is hosted using Github Pages and W3 validated. I utilized meta tags, Google and Bing webmaster tools, sitemaps, and code & network optimization techniques for SEO. I created my visuals using GIMP 2.
